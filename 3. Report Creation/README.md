## Structural Features

This section highlights how the physical characteristics of a home affect its market value:

- **Lot Area vs Sale Price**: Scatter plot showing the effect of land size on sale price, identifying diminishing marginal returns after certain thresholds.
- **Basement Area Analysis**: Visualizes relationships between `BsmtFinSF2`, `TotalBsmtSF`, and price, helping to identify under- or over-utilized basement space.
- **Exterior Material and Condition**: Box plots that compare average prices across different `Exterior1st` materials and `OverallCond` scores.
- **Renovation Impact**: Bar chart showing how recent remodeling boosts value, especially for older homes.

## Recommendations

This section offers data-driven guidance for homebuyers, sellers, and real estate professionals:

- **For Sellers**:  
  - Prioritize finishing basements and recent renovations for maximum ROI.  
  - Newer homes can command a premiumâ€”highlight construction date in listings.  

- **For Buyers**:  
  - Consider undervalued homes with large basements or recent updates.  
  - Use zoning and lot configuration data to assess long-term investment potential.  

- **For Developers & Appraisers**:  
  - Track neighborhood-level features to better assess fair market value.  
  - Include more granular condition/quality metrics for valuation accuracy.

## Actionable Insights

- **Basement Size Is Key**: Total basement area is the single strongest predictor of sale price in this dataset.  
- **New Builds and Remodels Sell for More**: Recency of construction and updates have a large and consistent positive effect.  
- **Simple Condition Scores Are Weak Predictors**: `OverallCond` has minimal correlation with price â€” suggesting a need for better quality indicators.  
- **Even Simple Models Perform Well**: Linear regression and support vector models achieved sub-19% MPE with just 13 variables.
